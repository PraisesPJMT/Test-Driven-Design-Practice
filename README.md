# Test-Driven-Design-Practice
>In this project we implemented a class with some methods using test-driven development (TDD). 
> The idea is to write tests first and then the code.
> We created a class called `Solver` with the following methods:
> - `factorial` that takes one argument, an integer `num`, and returns the factorial for that number. The factorial is the multiplication of all integers from 1 to `num` and has the special case that the factorial of 0 is 1. This method only accepts 0 and positive integers, so if a negative integer is given it should raise an exception.
> - `reverse` that takes one argument, a string word, and returns word reversed (e.g. if word is `hello` it returns `olleh`).
> - `fizzbuzz` that takes one argument, an integer `num`, and returns a string. The returned string is constructed following these rules:
>   - When `num` is divisible by `3`, return `fizz`.
>   - When `num` is divisible by `5`, return `buzz`.
>   - When `num` is divisible by `3` and `5`, return `fizzbuzz`.
>   - Any other case, return `num` as a string (e.g. say `num` is `7` then return `7`).
